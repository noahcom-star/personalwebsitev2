          i love learning -- to learn is to grow, and the most successful people are the best learners. to not learn is to remain stagnant, and remaining stagnant isn't staying still, it's choosing to move towards failure. i just enjoy learning -- it's my third biggest hobby after eating + going out.

            i'm amazing at vibe coding. you should see some of the stuff i've built. actual coding on the other hand? pretty rough -- but it's a love/hate relationship because i'm obsessed with it. something not on here yet is that i'm an incoming intern @ Wealthsimple -- i'll work with their swe team which i'm super excited for. i'm constantly watching tutorials, and signing up for free courses to get better.

            i really love the idea of putting your ideas out there. not until lately had i realized how amazing the internet can be. not only that, but i truly believe writing trains a different part of your brain that is essential for both startups and life. when you're writing you're in this constant state of critical thinking (no ai allowed haha!) there's very few things (that i know of at least) that can do that.

            when i quit competitive soccer i felt "yucky" -- always stressed, out of shape, etc. that's where i found running -- it hurt so much i couldn't think about anything else. since then, i've ran half marathons and plan to run my first full marathon in fall 2025. Ironman's the goal.
